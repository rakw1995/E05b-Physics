# E05b-Physics
In this code, I am practicing 2d physics and collisions.

* main1.py
in main1.py, the goal is to make the ball fall by using gravity and accelaration.

* main2.py
in main2.py, we use the gravity and acceleration laws as we did in main1, but now we want the balls to bounce. to do this, we reverse the acceleration on x,y (dx,dy). 

* main3.py
in main3.py, we are now working with collisions. before changes are made, the animals on screen collide with each other, but tend to stick to each other and it doesn't look very realistic. to fix this, we use newton's second law involving mass, force, and acceleration. now the balls should bounce off each other with ease.
